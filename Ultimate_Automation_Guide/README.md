# Test Automation Guide

While there is an abundance of valuable content available on building tests with different tools, what’s often missing is the opportunity to apply the knowledge you've gained from reading, watching, or listening. The key to mastering any skill is deliberate practice. Just consuming content won't get you far. That’s the purpose why i'm creating this. It provides you with a hands-on test automation challenge, covering a range of tools and technologies that test automation engineers encounter in real-world projects.

By working through this repo step by step, you'll build a solution that can serve as a portfolio piece for your current or future employer. I'll try to update and add new challenges regularly.

### What will I learn?

This project covers:

* Step 4: [Working with Git and GitHub to bring our code under version control](04-bring-our-code-under-version-control.md)
* Step 5: [Running our tests as part of a CI pipeline](05-running-our-tests-in-a-ci-pipeline.md)
* Step 6: [Working with an API testing library](06-working-with-an-api-testing-library.md)
* Step 7: [Parameterizing your tests](07-parameterizing-your-tests.md)
* Step 8: [Serializing objects to JSON](08-serializing-objects-to-json.md)
* Step 9: [Adding a first UI test](09-adding-a-first-ui-test.md)
* Step 10: [Running our UI tests in CI](10-running-our-ui-tests-in-ci.md)
* Step 11: [Working with waiting and synchronization strategies](11-waiting-and-synchronization-techniques.md)
* Step 12: [Separating the 'what' from the 'how' in our UI tests](12-separating-the-what-from-the-how.md)
* Step 13: [Further improvements for our code](13-further-improvements-for-our-code.md)

### How is the workshop material presented?

This repo does not provide step-by-step instructions for every single action. Instead, the goal is for you to explore, solve problems, and build things on your own. Each step has a clear progression, with information on the 'why?' and 'what?' (but not the 'how?'). I'll also include links to relevant learning resources where applicable. If you’re stuck, feel free to refer to a reference implementation for guidance. The primary goal, though, is to figure things out on your own. Encountering difficulties and searching for solutions is an important part of the learning journey.

### What tools can I use for this project?

The tools and languages you use are entirely up to you. This project is designed to be tool-agnostic, so you can choose any programming language or tools that suit you. So, whether you want to use Java, C#, Python, JavaScript with your libraries and test frameworks of choice, or if you want to use low-code tools like [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), it's up to you.

I will provide reference implementations for some of the most widely used languages and tools, and I’m open to including yours as well.

### What if I'm stuck?

If you’re stuck, that’s a good sign! It means you’re learning something new. Here are a few tips to help you get unstuck:

* Ask an experienced colleague for assistance
* Pair up with a fellow learner
* Search on Google / ChatGPT / StackOverflow / ...

If you're really, really stuck and still can't find an answer, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Tayyab0101/Automation-Testing-Projects/issues) on this repository and I (or maybe someone else) will gladly have a look at it.

### How can I get feedback on my work?

To receive feedback on your code:

* Pair program with a fellow learner while working on the exercises
* Ask an experienced coworker to review your code
Unfortunately, I can’t provide detailed individual feedback on your code personally.

### Can I contribute to this project?
Yes! There are several ways you can contribute:

* Provide a reference implementation for the project
* Submit a pull request with improvements or additions to the workshop content
* Spread the word about this project at your company or on social media
